              My work sits at the intersection of product strategy, design, and
              execution. I care about solving real user problems while keeping
              things clean, clear, and scalable.

              I&apos;ve worked with early-stage startups and growing SaaS teams
              to ship MVPs, improve conversion, and reduce design debt. Whether
              it&apos;s refining a product flow or building from zero, I bring
              clarity to complexity.

                I started my career in engineering but quickly moved into
                product and design when I realized I was more interested in
                &quot;why we&apos;re building&quot; than just &quot;what
                we&apos;re building.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then, I&apos;ve led cross-functional teams, redesigned
                SaaS dashboards, shipped AI tools, and helped founders find
                product-market fit. I&apos;m not just here to make things look
                good — I&apos;m here to make them work better.

                Every product starts with a problem. I begin by understanding
                the business case, the user context, and any technical
                constraints. That sets the foundation for fast, focused design.
              </p>
              <p>
                I work lean — designing just enough to test assumptions,
                validate early, and keep momentum. And I always keep dev handoff
                in mind, because good design is only useful when it ships.

                I partner with SaaS founders and product teams to launch and
                scale digital products. This includes MVP design, UX audits,
                feature design, and design systems.

                I can work solo or embedded with your team — async-first, always
                aligned with your roadmap. Most of my clients come back for
                multiple projects because I deliver clean, effective outcomes
                without overthinking.

                I’m currently based in India but work with clients globally.
                Outside of work, I’m learning piano, experimenting with new
                tools, and trying to build healthier habits — slowly but surely.

              <p>
                I occasionally write about design, product thinking, and remote
                work. I believe sharing what I learn is the best way to stay
                sharp and give back.

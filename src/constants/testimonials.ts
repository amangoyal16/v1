    quote: `Aman worked with us at a critical point of our product development. We had just scheduled our Alpha Launch and wanted to optimize our application for mobile devices. We had a tight timeline and Aman was able to direct the team in a way that got us to the finish line and ensured that the designs were user friendly.

    He was very proactive in suggesting changes to the UI/UX and I felt like I had someone in the cockpit with me driving as opposed to someone just doing the work because he had to. It was a great experience and would recommend working with Aman any time!

    Thanks Aman for your efforts and a successful launch!`,

    question: 'Do I need to sign a long-term contract?',
    answer:
      "Nope. All work is done on a month-to-month or per-project basis. You're free to cancel, pause, or restart anytime with just a 7-day notice.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: 'When do I need to pay?',
    answer:
      'Payment is required upfront before we begin working together. For monthly retainers, the full month is billed in advance. For fixed-scope projects, 50% is paid upfront and 50% on completion — or 100% upfront for smaller scopes.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: 'How can I hire you for a project?',
    answer:
      "You can either fill out the contact form above or email me directly at <a class='text-blue-500 underline' href='mailto:amangoyal676@gmail.com'>amangoyal676@gmail.com</a>. We'll discuss your needs and how I can help.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'Why choose monthly instead of fixed projects?',
    answer:
      'Monthly Design Partnership is ideal for ongoing design needs. With a retainer, you get continuous access and priority attention from me. You can also add new requests at any time without having to sign a new contract. <br/> <br/> As I get to know your business better, I can deliver better and faster results. Fixed projects work best for one-time tasks. They have a clear scope and a set deadline.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "What's my design delivery process?",
    answer:
      'I keep it simple and clear. We together begin by understanding your business needs. Then, we move to design concepts, revisions, and delivery. <br/> <br/> You’ll receive regular updates and chances for feedback. This way, you always know our progress and what’s next.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: 'How quickly can I get started?',
    answer:
      "I like to get started as soon as possible. My availability can vary throughout the year - send me an email with more information about your project to see if it's a good fit.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: 'What happens if I want to pause or stop the retainer?',
    answer:
      'You can pause or cancel anytime with 7 days’ notice. Unused hours won’t roll over, but we can always restart when you’re ready.',
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: 'Can I get a refund if I don’t use all the hours?',
    answer:
      'I don’t offer partial refunds on retainers. If your scope shifts mid-month, I’ll help you adjust and make the most of the remaining time.',
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: 'Is there any paperwork involved?',
    answer:
      'Only a simple 1-page service agreement — nothing legal-heavy. It just outlines scope, deliverables, payment terms, and helps keep everything clear. <br/> <br/> I can provide you with a detailed proposal if needed before we begin working together.',
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: 'We have wireframes, can you work with these?',
    answer:
      "Absolutely! I'll utilize the wireframes as a foundation for the general content and structure and build out the visual design on top.",
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: 'How do we communicate during the project?',
    answer:
      "We'll use Slack for quick async updates, Figma or Notion for deliverables, and weekly calls (if you're on retainer) to keep things on track.",
  },

    question: 'Why choose monthly instead of fixed projects??',
    answer: `Monthly Design Partnership is ideal for ongoing design needs. With a retainer, you get continuous access and priority attention from me. You can also add new requests at any time without having to sign a new contract. <br/> <br/> As I get to know your business better, I can deliver better and faster results. Fixed projects work best for one-time tasks. They have a clear scope and a set deadline.`,

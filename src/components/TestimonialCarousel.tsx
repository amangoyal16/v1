    text: 'Aman worked with us at a critical point of our product development. We had just scheduled our Alpha Launch and wanted to optimize our application for mobile devices. We had a tight timeline and Aman was able to direct the team in a way that got us to the finish line and ensured that the designs were user friendly. He was very proactive in suggesting changes to the UI/UX and I felt like I had someone in the cockpit with me driving as opposed to someone just doing the work because he had to. It was a great experience and would recommend working with Aman any time! Thanks Aman for your efforts and a successful launch!',

He consistently gave 100 percent effort to the team and played a significant role in ensuring that we completed assignments on time. He had excellent time management skills and had a knack for keeping everyone calm and productive during intense crunch periods. We miss his smile in the college! Any team would be lucky to have Aman, and I couldn't recommend him more for any business looking for new talent.",

Not once did he raise the motivation of the whole team with his energetic and adventurous approach to solving problems. I highly recommend Aman as a professional programmer whose work in the team makes other team members strive for better results.",

    text: 'As a partners on several projects, I was impressed with his ability to consider â€“ and balance â€“ strategic issues, creative concepts and practical considerations. It was also impressive to watch him (over a period of several months) shepherd a very important and complex launch campaign through numerous client presentations and shifts in direction. These "big picture" skills are matched by a keen eye and a real attention to detail. He is the personality who have abilities to learn new things quickly and bring your imagination into reality cartoon characters are the real life friend for him to work on creative art. I strongly recommend Aman Goyal for these skills.',
